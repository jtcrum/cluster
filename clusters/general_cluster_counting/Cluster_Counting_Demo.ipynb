    "The reactivity of meterials always depends on the distribution of important groups of atoms. Here we will refer the important groups of atoms as clusters. Given the bulk material property, such as the element ratio, we want to compute the distributions of the clusters in order to quantitatively understand the reactivity. The ultimate goal of this cluster counting module is to statistically compute the cluster distributions for different conditions, such as different crystal structures, different rules for atom locations, and different counting and titration priorities. This ultimate goal can be further divided into four specific goals. First, given a crystal structure, we want to understand the lattice and be able to identify distinct clusters. Next, we want to be able to count different type of clusters given a structure configuration (which specifies the atom type at each site). Thirdly, we would like to generate randome structure configurations for any given element ratio. Last, we want to titrate clusters one by one to avoid double counting clusters that share sites with each other. "

    "To achieve this goal, we took advantage of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) developed by Axel van de Walle. In ATAT, the corrdump program takes lattice parameters and site positions as input, determines the space group of the lattice, and find all symmetrically distinct clusters based on the space group. When analyzing distinct clusters, corrdump only count for sites which are possbile for at least two types of elements. The sites which can accommodate only one type of element will only help with analyzing symmetries. The installation and modification of ATAT can be found in supporting information."

Other rules, such as excluding certain cluster types, might also exist.

For example, 3Al in 6-membered-rings is a particular 3-body cluster type.

Another rule is the probability of centain atoms at different sites may not be the same. For ferrierite, there are four types of T-sites. The probability of Al at different T-sites may vary with the synthesis process. To generate random configurations with/without rules, we need 3 steps.\n",

When counting the clusters, we count both clusters if they both meet the requirements when they share sites with each other. While in reactions, if one cluster reacts, the atoms in the cluster will participate in the reaction. The clusters that share site with the reacted cluster cannot further react. So we need a titration function to titrate the clusters one by one. After each titration, we mark the sites in the titrated cluster as used and won't titrate clusters sharing sites with the titrated cluster in the future. Another thing that we need to consider is that, not all the clusters types have the same reaction priority. Some types may react first and only all the clusters in these types are all used up, the other types of clusters can start to react. To complete this task, we need 3 steps.\n",

Create an available cluster list with all the clusters that have the required atoms, being the type in the titration group, and not in the excluding cluster set.

After each titration, add 1 for the cluster type that the titrated cluster belongs to, change the sites in the titrated cluster to used sites in the structure configuration, and remove all the clusters that share sites with it from the available cluster list.
